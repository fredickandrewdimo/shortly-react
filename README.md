# Shortly

Shortly is a website that can shorten any web link that you enter. It is fast and has been built using React JS and Tailwind CSS. The design of the website is responsive, which means it works well on different screen sizes, and it has been made to be easy to use. The website uses a free API called shrtcode to shorten your links quickly and accurately.
