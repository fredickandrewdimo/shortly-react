# Shortly

Shortly is a website that can shorten any web link that you enter. It is fast and has been built using React JS and Tailwind CSS. The design of the website is responsive, which means it works well on different screen sizes, and it has been made to be easy to use. The website uses a free API called shrtcode to shorten your links quickly and accurately.

## Lessons Learned

Through this project, I gained knowledge and experience in using React, including using state management with the useState hook and implementing React Router. Additionally, I learned how to export data from other files and make responsive designs using Tailwind CSS. Finally, I also learned how to deploy a Vite React project to Github Pages using Github Actions.
